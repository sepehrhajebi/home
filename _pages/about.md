I am a PhD student in Combinatorics and Optimization at University of Waterloo, working with <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/sophiespirkl/'>Sophie Spirkl</a>.\
I expect to graduate in Spring 2024.

Currently I study structural combinatorics, mostly induced subgraphs and graph minors, and sometimes algorithms.\
I am also interested in a few other areas including algebraic and geometric topology and analytic number theory.
