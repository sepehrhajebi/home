I will soon start as a Junior Faculty (Instructor) in the <a href='https://www.math.princeton.edu'>Department of Mathematics</a> at <a href='https://www.princeton.edu'>Princeton University</a>.

I completed my PhD in <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/'>Combinatorics and Optimization</a> at the <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca'>University of Waterloo</a> in August 2024.\
My thesis was: _<a href='https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/0ff1e564-5de5-48bd-9ffc-58bd5950c99b'>Foreshadowing the Grid Theorem for Induced Subgraphs</a>_.\
My advisor was <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/sophiespirkl/'>Sophie Spirkl</a>. 

Currently my research is in structural combinatorics, mostly induced subgraphs and graph minors, and sometimes algorithms.\
I am also interested in a few other areas including algebraic and geometric topology and analytic number theory.

"Imagine a lifetime of this struggle, always probing and rejecting, and this constant dedication to perfection, to the principle of inevitability. Somehow this is the key, the only key we can have to the mystery of a great artist, that for reasons unknown to him, or to anybody else for that matter, he will give away his life and his energies just to make sure that one note follows the other with complete inevitability. Seems rather an odd way to spend one’s life. But it isn’t so odd when we think that the composer by doing this leaves us at the finish with the feeling that something is right in the world, that checks throughout, something that follows its own law consistently, something we can trust, that will never let us down."
