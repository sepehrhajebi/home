**<a href="{{ 'Publications.pdf' | prepend: 'assets/pdf/' | relative_url}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a>** is a list of my (total of 24) papers in the reverse chronological order, with details such as my coauthors and the publication status.

I have also grouped my papers according to their subjects:
